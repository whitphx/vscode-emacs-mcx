  # For security reasons, this workflow is separated from the test-and-build workflow and triggered by the `workflow_run` event following it.
  # The deployment jobs need access to the repository secrets,
  # however, workflows triggered by the `pull_request` event don't have access to the secrets for security reasons
  # because those workflows check out the PR's branch that may have malicious external contributors' changes,
  # so we can't use the `pull_request` event to trigger the deployment jobs.
  # Then, we have to run the deployment jobs in this separated workflow that is allowed to access the secrets because it runs in the context of the default branch which can be considered as a trusted branch.
  # It is a security good practice introduced in the GitHub's official blog, https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
