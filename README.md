This Visual Studio Code extension provides Emacs-like keybindings and operations.
This is inspired by [the great VSCcode extension by hiro-sun](https://github.com/hiro-sun/vscode-emacs) and its forks such as [vscode-emacs-friendly by Sebastian Zaha](https://github.com/SebastianZaha/vscode-emacs-friendly), [vscode-emacs-improved by rkwan94](https://github.com/rkwan94/vscode-emacs), and [vscode-emacs-neon by NotKyon](https://github.com/NotKyon/vscode-emacs-neon).

Though there were such great extensions, this extension is written from scratch because it was hard to achieve the goal listed below by extending the existent codebase.

This extension aims
* to provide Emacs-like keybindings
* to be fully compatible with multi cursor
* to support kill-ring integrated with the system clipboard
* to support mark-ring
* to support prefix argument
* to support sexp
* to fix some bugs in the existing extensions such as
    * mark-mode states are shared among all editors

This extension makes use of code in the existent extensions listed above and, in addition, [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and [VSCode Vim extension](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim). Thanks for all these great works.
Mainly, almost all keybinding settings are derived from [vscode-emacs-friendly by Sebastian Zaha](https://github.com/SebastianZaha/vscode-emacs-friendly).

## FAQ
### The cursor cannot be moved on the find widget as the widget closes with movement keys.
It's an intended design that simulates the original Emacs' behavior.
You can disable it with `emacs-mcx.cursorMoveOnFindWidget` option described below.
See https://github.com/whitphx/vscode-emacs-mcx/issues/137 for the details about this topic.

### i-search (`C-s`) is initialized with the currently selected string and the previous search is removed.
This is VSCode's design that an extension cannot control.
To disable it, you should set `editor.find.seedSearchStringFromSelection` VSCode setting as `"never"`.
It makes the find widget work similarly to Emacs.

Refs:
* [The official doc about `editor.find.seedSearchStringFromSelection` setting](basics#_seed-search-string-from-selection)
* [The GitHub issue where we discuss about it](https://github.com/whitphx/vscode-emacs-mcx/issues/107)

## Extension settings
This extension has some custom settings named with a prefix `emacs-mcx`.
You can configure those settings.
(See [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-editor) to know how to change the settings.)

Configurable options of this extension are the followings.

### `emacs-mcx.strictEmacsMove`
If set as true, the original emacs's cursor movements are strictly simulated.
If set as false, the VSCode's native cursor movements are preserved.
For example, if set as true, when you type `C-a`, the cursor moves to the beginning of the line (Emacs' original behavior).
If set as false, on the other hand, the cursor move to the first non-empty character in the line (VSCode's native behavior of Home key).

### `emacs-mcx.useMetaPrefixEscape`
If set as true, Escape key works as the Meta prefix like original Emacs.
If set as false, Escape key works as cancel, the VSCode's native behavior.
For example, if set as true, `M-f` (forward-word) can be issued by both `alt+f` and `escape f`.

The only exception is the commands which begin with `M-g` (`M-g g`, `M-g n`, `M-g p`).
It is because VSCode can handle only up to two key strokes as the key bindings.
So, as the special case, `Escape g` works as follows.

|Command | Desc |
|--------|------|
| `Escape g` | Jump to line (command palette) |

### `emacs-mcx.useMetaPrefixCtrlLeftBracket`
If set as true, `ctrl+[` works as the Meta prefix like original Emacs.

### `emacs-mcx.useMetaPrefixMacCmd`
If set as true, Command (⌘) key works as the Meta prefix like original Emacs on macOS.
This option only works on macOS.

### `emacs-mcx.killRingMax`
Configures the maximum number of kill ring entries.
The default is 60.

### `emacs-mcx.killWholeLine`
This simulates the original Emacs' [`kill-whole-line` variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Killing-by-Lines.html).
The default is false.

### `emacs-mcx.cursorMoveOnFindWidget`
If set to true, cursor move commands of this extension (`C-f`, `C-b`, `C-p`, `C-n`, `C-a`, `C-e`, `M-f`, `M-b`, and `M-m`) are disabled when the find widget is focused, to allow the widget to keep open and the cursor to move on it.

### `emacs-mcx.enableOverridingTypeCommand`
Prefix arguments do not work on character inputs with IMEs by default and you can set this config to `true` in order to enable it.
Note that this config makes use of VSCode API's `type` command under the hood and can cause problems in some cases.
* If you are using IME, text input may sometimes fail.
* If another extension that also uses the `type` command is installed, an error occurs (See https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/13441).

### `emacs-mcx.enableDigitArgument`
Indicates whether `M-<digit>` (the `emacs-mcx.digitArgument` command) is enabled.
Set `false` when `M-<digit>` conflicts with some other  necessary commands. See https://github.com/whitphx/vscode-emacs-mcx/issues/1208 for the background.

### `emacs-mcx.debug.*`
Configurations for debugging.

## 'when' clause context
This extension provides some contexts that you can refer to in `"when"` clauses of your `keybindings.json`.

### `emacs-mcx.inMarkMode`
*boolean*

This indicates whether mark-mode is enabled.

### `emacs-mcx.acceptingArgument`
*boolean*

This indicates the editor is accepting argument input following `C-u`.

### `emacs-mcx.prefixArgumentExists` (experimental)
*boolean*

This indicates if a prefix argument exists.
Use this boolean context to check the existence of a prefix argument, instead of using `emacs-mcx.prefixArgument` with null check.

### `emacs-mcx.prefixArgument` (experimental)
*number | undefined*

This is a currently input prefix argument.


## Keymaps
Alt key is mapped to the Meta prefix (`M`) by default and you can configure for Escape, `ctrl+[`, or Command (⌘) key (macOS only) to work as it with the settings above.

If you prefer more Emacs-like behavior, [The "File Browser" extension by Bodil Stokke (`bodil.file-browser`)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bodil.file-browser) may help.) |

This extension makes use of [paredit.js](https://github.com/rksm/paredit.js) to provide sexp functionalities. Thank you for this great library.

## Other commands
### `emacs-mcx.executeCommandWithPrefixArgument`
This command calls another command with the prefix argument.
This is mainly for extension developers who want to make the extensions collaborative with this extension's prefix argument. See [the issue #1146](https://github.com/whitphx/vscode-emacs-mcx/issues/1146) for the discussion about it.

For example, if you define the keybinding below,
* `C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{}`.
* `C-u C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{ prefixArgument: 4 }`.
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+x e",
  "command": "emacs-mcx.executeCommandWithPrefixArgument",
  "args": {
    "command": "foo"
  }
}
```

You can pass the arguments to the target command as below. In this case,
* `C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{ baz: 42 }`.
* `C-u C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{ prefixArgument: 4, baz: 42 }`.
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+x e",
  "command": "emacs-mcx.executeCommandWithPrefixArgument",
  "args": {
    "command": "foo",
    "args": {
      "baz": 42
    }
  }
}
```

You can change the key name of the prefix argument.
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+x e",
  "command": "emacs-mcx.executeCommandWithPrefixArgument",
  "args": {
    "command": "foo",
    "prefixArgumentKey": "repeat"
  }
}
```
* `C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{}`.
* `C-u C-x e` will call the command `foo` with the argument `{ repeat: 4 }`.
